# Autonomous Loop State

**Assigned project:** `C:\Users\--\repos\Aura`
**Current pass:** 2026-06-06 Cycle 22 roadmap/research/implementation pass
**Last commit before pass:** `ec90256` (`feat(legal): add provider disclosure matrix`)

## 2026-06-05 Result

- Shipped a partial provider/content-source compliance slice: central `ProviderDisclosure` model, Licenses screen integration, legal provider policy matrix doc, and unit coverage for complete `ContentSource` disclosure rows.
- Expanded visible Licenses screen rows for missing runtime/native dependencies as a stopgap before generated OSS notices.
- Verified on a local mirror with `.\gradlew.bat --no-daemon --max-workers=2 :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests com.freevibe.data.legal.ProviderDisclosureTest` after installing Android SDK command-line tools, Android 35 platform, build-tools 35.0.0, and platform-tools.

## 2026-06-06 Result

- Completed Cycle 18 roadmap/research pass for generated release-runtime OSS notices, license drift gates, SBOM/release artifacts, and native/copyleft packet planning.
- Added `docs/research/cycle-18-2026-06-06.md` with local evidence and verified primary-source research.
- Completed Cycle 19 roadmap/research pass for current-toolchain notice tooling sequence and AboutLibraries version gating.
- Added `docs/research/cycle-19-2026-06-06.md` with local Gradle/workflow inspection and primary-source plugin research.
- Completed Cycle 20 isolated compatibility spikes for Google OSS notices and AboutLibraries 14.2.1 under `work/`.
- Added `docs/research/cycle-20-2026-06-06.md` with exact commands, generated artifact paths, and spike results.
- Completed Cycle 21 plugin-only Google OSS notice generation and `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` markdown conversion spike.
- Added `docs/research/cycle-21-2026-06-06.md` with converter details, plugin-only generation results, Google runtime dependency convergence risk, and ProviderDisclosure preservation notes.
- Completed Cycle 22 real-repo plugin-only Google OSS notice implementation, markdown converter, release artifact wiring, and focused verification.
- Added `docs/research/cycle-22-2026-06-06.md` with implementation files, verification commands, dependency graph check results, and remaining gaps.
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` with Cycle 18, Cycle 19, Cycle 20, Cycle 21, and Cycle 22 P0/P1 handoff items, Appendix V/W/X/Y/Z sources, and a `Continuation State` section.
- Implemented Google OSS licenses Gradle plugin first without `play-services-oss-licenses:17.5.1`; generated notices with `:app:releaseOssLicensesTask`; added `tools/google_oss_to_markdown.py`; wired `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` into release artifacts/checksums.
- Verification: real-repo `:app:releaseOssLicensesTask` passed after refreshing POM checksum metadata; converter generated 251 dependency records and 288 notice sections; release runtime graph did not show `play-services-oss-licenses`, Activity Compose 1.12.1, Compose 1.11.0-beta02, or Material Components 1.13.0.
- ProviderDisclosure focused unit test now passes with `JAVA_HOME` set to Android Studio JBR and `ANDROID_HOME` set to the local Android SDK.
- Decision: keep the stock Google runtime/activity behind a dependency convergence audit; next compliance gap is native/copyleft payload inspection.
- Did not run full Gradle APK/lint builds; Cycle 22 used focused Gradle notice/dependency tasks because `CLAUDE.md` warns repeated APK/lint runs can exhaust this workstation.
- Recent history was checked with `rtk git log -10 --oneline --decorate` for this pass.

## Still Open

- Generated OSS notices and license drift gate.
- Copyleft/native extractor compliance packet for NewPipe, youtubedl-android, yt-dlp/Python payloads, and FFmpeg.
- Generated Gradle runtime dependency inventory comparison and notice-diff gate.
- Runtime provider kill switches and disabled-provider behavior.

## Next Cycle

Continue this same assigned project, Aura. Start from Cycle 22. Read `ROADMAP.md` Continuation State and `docs/research/cycle-22-2026-06-06.md` first. The Google OSS notices plugin-only path is now implemented in the real repo without adding `play-services-oss-licenses:17.5.1`; `tools/google_oss_to_markdown.py` generates `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`; release workflow packages it with checksums. Next start the native/copyleft payload inspector for youtubedl-android library/ffmpeg AARs and NewPipeExtractor source-offer evidence. Keep AboutLibraries secondary: 14.2.1 configures, but default exports were incomplete and the compliance export logged Windows path errors; do not use AboutLibraries 15.x until N-1 upgrades AGP because v15 requires AGP 8.13. Commit and push completed work when the active project contract allows it.
